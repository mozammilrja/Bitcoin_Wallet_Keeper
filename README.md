## Usage

### Generating a Wallet
1. Navigate to the "Generate Wallet" tab
2. Enter a secure password (minimum 8 characters)
3. Confirm the password
4. Click "Generate Wallet"
5. Your encrypted wallet will be saved locally

### Managing Wallets
1. Go to the "My Wallets" tab to see all saved wallets
2. Click on any wallet to view its details
3. Use the delete button to remove unwanted wallets

### Viewing Private Keys
1. Select a wallet from your wallet list
2. Enter the wallet's password
3. Click "View Private Key"

5. Copy the private key using the copy button

### Checking Balances
1. Select a wallet
2. Click "Refresh" next to the balance section
3. The balance will be fetched from Sepolia testnet

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never share your private keys** - Anyone with access to your private key can control your wallet
2. **Use strong passwords** - Choose passwords with at least 8 characters, including numbers and symbols
3. **Backup your wallets** - Keep secure backups of your encrypted wallet files
4. **Verify addresses** - Always double-check wallet addresses when sending funds
5. **Test with small amounts** - Use testnet for testing before mainnet operations

## Testnet Usage

This application is configured to work with Sepolia testnet. To get test ETH:

1. Copy your wallet address
2. Visit a Sepolia faucet (e.g., faucet.sepolia.org)
3. Request test ETH using your address
4. Refresh your wallet balance in the app

## Development

### Code Organization
- Components are organized by functionality
- Each file maintains single responsibility
- Redux slices handle specific state domains
- Utility functions provide reusable logic

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for utility functions
- Integration tests for Redux logic
- Component tests for UI behavior
- Mocked external dependencies
